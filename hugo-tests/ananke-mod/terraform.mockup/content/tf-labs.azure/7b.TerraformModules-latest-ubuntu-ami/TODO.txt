terraform get
Let's use the terraform get function which works like terraform init but only pulls modules, not providers.
Note: This is just to demonstrate that terraform get exists and can be used - the real use case would be to obtain the latest version of a remote module, when updated on GitHub or on the Terraform Registry.


Note that the terraform get recognizes the existence and location of the local modules.
If not present locally the modules would have been downloaded from the Terraform Registry modules (https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules)
